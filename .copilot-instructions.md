# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Environment Setup
- **Shell**: Always use PowerShell commands (Windows PowerShell v5.1)
- **Docker**: ALWAYS use Docker containers - never run Node.js directly on the host
- **Primary tool**: Use `docker-compose` for development and deployment

## Development Workflow
- Use `docker-compose up` to start the application
- Use `docker-compose down` to stop services
- For package management, run npm commands inside Docker containers

## Project Structure
This is a Node.js/Express application with the following structure:
- `src/data/` - JSON data files
- `src/public/` - Static frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- `server.js` - Main Express server file

## Commands Examples
- Start development: `docker-compose up --build`
- Install packages: `docker-compose exec app npm install <package>`
- Run commands in container: `docker-compose exec app <command>`

## Notes
- Always consider Docker context when suggesting solutions
- Prefer PowerShell syntax for any shell commands
- This appears to be a contract movements tracking application
